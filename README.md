How to create a MVC framework

This is a tutorial on how to create your own framework.

Remember to create the table for MySQL/MariaDB. The description is in the "start info" when you start the app.

It can be some places in the code that tab levels is not correct. I only use Notepad++.

I have also added one limitation demostration  when selecting color in the color picker. You can not select any shades of the blue color.

You will learn database, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MVC, and how to load and save to the database ith AJAX from PHP.

You can do it without AJAX and Javascript, but here we show how to combine Javascript with PHP, and it is useful to know when you build a MVC.

You can easily change the code. Try to add a header to it, and you see how easy it is.
This MVC is not complete. It is only for tutorial and learning.

Just load the code to your public server page, and run it.
